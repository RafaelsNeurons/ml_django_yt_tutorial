Building a Django App which includes a ML-Model of Sklearn to predict the sportactivity of a person

Goal:
I was following this tutorial to become more confitent with Django and also to learn how I can connect a Machine Learning Model with a Python Application
The Model was trained in Google Colab. First I tried to train it with a Macbook Air M1 but I faced problems to install Sklearn. Thats why I used Colab and later 
for the implementation of the Django-App is used a Windows-Laptop.
